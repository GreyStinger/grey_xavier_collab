      <p>What is it and where does coffee come from</p>
      <p>
        Coffee is a drink made from coffee beans that have been roasted and ground into a powder.
         Coffee is a commodity in the world that is cultivated in more than 50 countries. Two 
         species of coffee trees that are generally known are Robusta Coffee (Coffea canephora) 
         and Arabica Coffee (Coffea arabica).

      <p>That's what is on my mind when drinking coffee ...</p>
      <p>
        The processing of coffee before it can be drunk goes through a long process, namely harvesting 
        the ripe coffee beans either by machine or by hand, then processing the coffee beans and drying 
        them before turning into logs. The next process is roasting with varying degrees. After roasting, 
        the coffee beans are ground or ground into a coffee powder before the coffee can be drunk. History 
        records that the discovery of coffee as a nutritious and energy drink was first discovered by the 
        Ethiopians on the African continent about 3000 years (1000 BC) ago. Coffee then continues to grow 
        until now it is one of the most popular drinks in the world which is consumed by various groups of 
        people. [citation needed] Indonesia alone has been able to produce more than 400 thousand tons of coffee 
        per year. Besides the taste and aroma that is attractive, coffee can also reduce the risk of cancer, 
        diabetes, gallstones, and various heart diseases (cardiovascular)
